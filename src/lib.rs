//! # DID Resolver
//!
//! This crate provides common utilities for the Vercre project and is not
//! intended to be used directly.
//!
//! The crate provides a DID Resolver trait and a set of default implementations
//! for resolving DIDs.
//!
//! See [DID resolution](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-resolution) fpr more.

// TODO: add support for the following:
//   key type: EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019 | JsonWebKey2020 |
// Ed25519VerificationKey2020 |             Ed25519VerificationKey2018 |
