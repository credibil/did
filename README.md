# Decentralized Identifier (DID) Tools

This crate provides a set of tools and utilities for working with a subset of 
[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

## Supported Methods

The crate supports the following DID methods (used by `vercre-vc` and `vercre-dwn`):

- [did:key](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/)
- [did:web](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/)
- [did:jwk](https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md/)

with plans to support [did:dht](https://did-dht.com/) in the near future.

## Usage

The library supports basic DID resolution and document creation. It does not (yet) support
publishing a `did:web` document to a web server.

maintain this on my own currently and have limited time. I appreciate
suggestions but sometimes the associate workload can seem daunting. That means
that simplifications to the workflow are also *highly* appreciated.
